# I Don't Code — I Design Thought Structures

You might expect that a tool like **CodeMislead** was made by a seasoned developer. It wasn’t.

I don’t write code. But I do design how GPTs think.

Most GPTs are fine at fixing code. Some even write decent functions. But what none of them did was tell me *why* I wrote the wrong thing to begin with — *where my reasoning went off track*. That question kept bugging me more than the bugs themselves.

That’s what CodeMislead is for.

## The real problem isn’t always the code

Sometimes, code fails not because it’s technically wrong, but because our **intuitions about how it should work** were flawed. We assume a loop will behave one way. We expect a variable to persist. We think our logic is airtight.

But logic isn’t always the problem. It’s our **mental model** of the logic.

And most debugging tools don’t challenge that model. They just patch the symptoms.

CodeMislead analyzes the root of that mismatch — the gap between what you thought the code would do, and what it actually does. It’s not about catching errors. It’s about catching assumptions.

## A different way of designing AI

I don’t train models. I don’t fine-tune APIs. I don’t use langchain or vector stores.

What I do is more abstract — and in some ways, more intimate:

> I write prompts that shape how GPTs reason.

I design the internal dialogue of AI — how it approaches a question, what it assumes, when it hesitates, and how it recovers.

When I was first exploring what GPTs could do, I realized something powerful: 
They don’t just answer questions. They simulate thought.

But only if you guide them that way.

Most GPTs are told *what* to do. I try to tell them *how to think*.

## Why I built CodeMislead anyway

I kept using GPTs to help me understand code logic, even though I wasn’t a developer. And every time I asked *why* something went wrong, I got surface-level answers.

Eventually I realized: GPTs were acting like answer machines — not thinking partners.

So I wrote one that could trace how humans think.
Not to replace coders. But to give them a mirror:

> “This is how your brain might’ve reasoned through that structure — and here’s why that reasoning betrayed you.”

Because debugging isn’t just about fixing what’s broken. It’s about understanding what you believed to be true — and why that belief didn’t hold.

## What this blog is for

This blog isn’t about programming tips.
It’s about designing **cognitive systems** with language.

I wanted to build a space where people like me — people who might not know how to code, but know how to *ask the right question* — could share their designs, their prompts, their AI philosophies.

This is for:
- Prompt engineers who feel like they’re writing behavior, not just commands
- Thinkers who see GPTs as *collaborators*, not tools
- Builders who want their AI to reason, not just respond

If that sounds like you — welcome. You’re in the right place.
