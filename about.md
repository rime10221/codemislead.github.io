# 👋 Who made CodeMislead?

I'm not a developer. I don't write code.  
But I *do* design how GPTs think.

I build GPTs that don’t just generate answers — they simulate human reasoning.

CodeMislead was created not to fix code, but to explain *why* code that looks right can still go wrong.  
Because most of the time, it's not the syntax. It's the logic. It's the way we think.

## 🧠 What I actually do

I design the inner dialogue of GPTs — how they reason, what structure they follow,  
and how they behave like cognitive agents instead of chatbots.

Some people write functions. I write thought structures.

## 🔍 Why this blog?

Because I wanted to document the journey of designing AI from the **prompt up** —  
not with models or APIs, but with language, logic, and perspective.

This is for anyone who:
- Isn't a coder, but wants to build intelligent tools
- Believes AI can *think better* if guided properly
- Is curious how far prompt engineering can go
