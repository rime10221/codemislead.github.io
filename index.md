# 👋 Welcome to CodeMislead

This is the official home of **CodeMislead** — the GPT that doesn't just debug your code, it debugs your thinking.

If you’ve ever written code that *seemed right*, but produced wrong results, this GPT was built for you.

> *“The bug wasn’t in your syntax. It was in your logic.”*

## 🔍 What does CodeMislead do?

- Analyzes **how you thought** when writing the code
- Explains **why your assumptions failed**
- Predicts **realistic outcomes** if your code runs as-is
- Suggests **structural redesigns** — not just patches

## 💡 How to use

1. Paste your code into the GPT prompt
2. (Optional) Add what you expected the code to do
3. CodeMislead will:
   - Infer your thinking
   - Simulate possible runtime behavior
   - Explain why the result might differ
   - Offer better structural logic
